# Extra Credit Wikis

When you are thinking about writing a wiki, please keep in mind that the purpose of a wiki page is to help current or future students, or provide tools that will make our lives (the instructional staff) easier in the future.  A good, current example of such a wiki post would be something like the notebooks/material that you find in the help folder.  Other good ideas for a wiki extra credit include, but are not limited to the following:

- New assignment problems that demonstrate things that you should be learning (these may or may not be posted in the wiki, depending on if we want to use them in the future).
- New data sets that can be analyzed, with examples of how to analyze this data and a summary on why it is interesting.
- New quiz/assessment questions (these will not be posted in the wiki, but will instead be possibly used in future courses!).
- New readings (required or optional) with summaries of why it is important and relevant to the course material we are going over.
- Links to websites that demonstrate concepts with a summary of why it is important and relevant to the course material
- Sample notebooks demonstrating some particular technique or tool.

Obviously, all of this work MUST be original (please read our section in the syllabus about plagiarism) and relevant to the course.  Also, in order to receive as many points as possible for your wiki, you should put a lot of thought and effort in to your post (ie, just linking to a good book and providing a one sentence summary about why it should be read will not cut it!). 

Before you start on a topic, it MUST be approved of ahead of time.  Also, please note that you will get a maximum of 5 extra credit points from a single wiki entry.  Once you have created a wiki post on an approved topic, you should email the undergraduate assistant, Taeyoung Kim, who will assign points to your post, suggest changes or improvements, and then publish your wiki page.
